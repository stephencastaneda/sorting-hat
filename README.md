## Decription

This project builds a form that allows you to submit your name and get assigned a random Harry Potter house. After you are assigned your house, a card prints with your assigned house. A unique color is also given based on house assignment. The cards were designed using bootstrap. There is also an "expel" button on the cards that allows you to delete your card.
